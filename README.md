# Chromebook Utilities Collection

## Important Update:
I won't be maintaining this repository anymore, but **don't worry!** The future of the project continues in a better place. All contributors and members are now encouraged to move to this repository:  
[Corellium - Repo](https://github.com/Burvyn/Corellium/tree/main)

Bwrn will now continue working on the future of chromebook-utilities at **Corellium**, and all updates, support, and contributions will happen there. Join them and help take this project to the next level! Letâ€™s build something amazing together!
