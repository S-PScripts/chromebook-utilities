<h4>TASK FOR BCMGF1137: Remove anything critical of Hexagon! (there shouldn't be much)</h4>
  
  <p><i>Warning - this place IS under construction! Empty and incomplete pages are expected. There may be typos, and if there are, comment where they are and I will fix them.</i></p>
This is not fake. I also have a volatile nature (according to Blue and I actually agree with him) so if I post anything offensive, talk to me a few hours after I post it and I will be more forgiving. (unless it is about the prophet Muhammad. You cannot forgive anyone who banged a 9 year old while he was like 53)

  <h2>What is H: The Series?</h2>

  <p>
  <blockquote>"H: The Series is a series of projects that people (including you, possibly) make for fun!"</blockquote>
  <br />
  - Literally the studio description
  </p>
  <p>
    Oh, and did you know that <b><a href="https://discord.gg/2fHVnBRDBu">H: The Server</a></b> exists? Anyone can join, but please proceed with caution! Discord is toxic, so my parents won't let me have an account because they are boomers (they are actually gen x but idc)...
    <br><br><br>
    Also, what could <b><a href="iqh-demo">this</a></b> be??
    <br>
    If you have any questions, ask <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dimayajonelcid">BCMGF1137/19</a>, but not me, as I am banned from H as of October 2023.
