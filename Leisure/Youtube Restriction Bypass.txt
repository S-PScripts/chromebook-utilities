These are some youtube video links that might be able to unblock restricted videos on your school account:
This will not work when trying to open age restricted videos, google patched them all :(
VIDEOIDHERE should be the youtube video id, a 11 character string unique to every video that's the second half of all youtube links.

Here's the two formats of youtube links...
https://youtube.com/watch?v=SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS
https://youtu.be/SOMERANDOMCHARACTERS

Links:
https://youtube.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE
https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIDEOIDHERE

Javascript version:
javascript:(function () {if (window.location.toString().includes('www.youtube.com/watch?v%27)) { window.open(%27https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/%27 + window.location.toString().split(%27=%27)[1]) }})()

Example:
https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
In this case, the video id would be dQw4w9WgXcQ.
