Classroom.cloud - State Of Mind

-> My school in year 9 (2023)/grade 8 got this crappy GoGuardian ripoff called classroom.cloud. It's a spyware, yipee!
-> During year 9, only a few people got detentions for playing games and stuff whilst the teacher was using the extension.
-> That's because when the teacher used it the extension gave a popup on everyone's screens saying something like:
   "Your teacher wants to see your screen real bad so you should click the share button! Thank you very much"
-> Another thing was that you could change your time zone. Once you changed it, classroom.cloud would not work!

-> Year 10 (2024)... winter. the classroom.cloud developers fix their extension. No time zone glitches. No popup. Disaster - many people get detentions. 
-> Someone literally got a detention today even though it's been months since the fix occurred. Unfortunately, most people have failed to realise classroom.cloud had a quirk...
-> COLOUR. When the extension is blue, it is available (teacher can turn it on), orange means that it is out of hours (teacher can't turn it on), green means that DANGER!
-> All you had to do was pin the dang extension and watch its colour. But surprise... most of the people that play games or watch sport during class are the dummies/half-technologically challenged. 
-> Maybe I'm being harsh since I'm not technologically challenged but I'm surprised only a few people have figured this out.
-> update: so the time zone glitch works sorta but you gotta use it before the teacher actually turns it on lol
