# DISCLAIMER
I, S-PScripts, owner and main maintainer of chromebook-utilities, am not responsible for any issues you may encounter from viewing or using my GitHub repository.
Your decision to use my repository in an inappropriate situation is your own responsibility.

To teachers who have caught students misusing this resource:
- I am not at fault for providing this site and related materials for public access.
- I do not approve of students playing games or using proxies instead of doing their work.
- A moderate approach to discipline is recommended, such as temporarily taking away the device and notifying their parents.
- Severe punishment is unnecessary unless the student repeatedly misuses the resource; in that case, handle it as you see fit.

**Users, consider this your warning.**
