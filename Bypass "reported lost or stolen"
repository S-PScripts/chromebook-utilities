Bypass "reported lost or stolen" screen when enrolled

Notes:
This trick is inconsistent and has not been tested on a large scope (Only tested on R117 and R124). It could very well just not work sometimes, but it did work for some people.

Instructions:
-> If you get met with "This device is reported lost or stolen" (not during the OOBE!) on boot, this message is just a hidden kiosk app. You can cancel the loading of it on boot.
-> When the ChromeOS logo pops up after a reboot, just spam CTRL + ALT + S. The screen will cancel loading and you'll just be plopped back in the sign-in screen. It's that easy.
