Enabling Skiovox:
1. Go to skiovox-helper (https://github.com/bypassiwastaken/skiovox-helper)

5. Go to the three dots in the top right corner of the window (where the x is) and click on New window.
6. Type in chrome://extensions and enable Developer mode. Click Load Unpacked. 
7. Go into the folder in Downloads and there should be another folder within that one. Select it but don't go into it. Click open.

Notes:
Make sure to always open a new window (three dots), as this will allow you to upload files to things (Discord etc).

Known issues:
-> Skiovox deleting itself from extensions (manifest).
To fix this problem, delete the current Skiovox file from your downloads, pull the Skiovox file from the USB drive back into the downloads and link it again.
-> ESC not working to bypass the message in Step 7. There is no fix for this currently.

You're finished! You now have Skiovox downloaded on this Kiosk app. Also, this can work with any Kiosk app now that you have Skiovox downloaded onto a USB drive.
