Instructions:
1. Go to https://translate.google.com
2. Insert any link on the left side of the translator (include the https://)
3. Click the link on the right side of the translator.
4. The website should be unblocked!

Notes:
-> This doesn't work well with a lot of websites.

-> If https://translate.google.com is blocked for you, replace the <PUTYOURURLHERE> below with the website you want to go to:
https://www-<PUTYOURURLHERE>.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp

--> MAKE SURE THAT ALL PERIODS (.) IN THE LINK YOU ARE USING ARE REPLACED WITH DASHES (-). For example, https://www-roblox-com.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp
