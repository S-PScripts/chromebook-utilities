I found out recently that if you can somehow get WebGL to crash, you can access websites without GoGuardian redirecting you.

1: Make a bookmark of the website you want to visit.
2: Get WebGL to crash, I don't know how to do this other than being teleported to a large amount of players within your render distance while in fullscreen in EaglercraftX sometimes.
3: Rapidly click the bookmark, should be like four times, until GoGuardian stops redirecting you.
