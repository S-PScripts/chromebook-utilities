With CorkGuardian, you can freeze GoGuardian!
You have to have the toggle in toolbar option on for GoGuardian in the chrome://extensions tab.

Instructions:
Method 1:
1. Turn off your Wi-Fi.
2. Sign out.
3. Sign back in.
4. Open a new tab without restoring your old tabs.
5. Rapidly click on the GoGuardian extension until it turns dark grey.
6. Turn your wifi back on.
7. Have fun browsing anything you want.

Method 2:
1. Turn off your Wi-Fi.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/?id=haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh
3. Flip on and off the allow access to file urls button.
4. Rapidly click on the GoGuardian extension until it turns dark grey.
5. Turn your wifi back on.
6. Have fun browsing anything you want.

Notes:
This only bypasses GoGuardian!
Any other blockers (like LightSpeed) or network blocks aren't bypassed. 
This works on at least v122. Signing out again will remove the blocks, and you have to do the process again.
