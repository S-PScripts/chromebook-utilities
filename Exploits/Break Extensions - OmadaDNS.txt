Omada is a community and small group of people working on hosting free and open-source services on the basis of freedom, privacy and decentralisation. 
One of these services is Omada DNS, which breaks Lightspeed, Securly, GoGuardian and more from working simply using a network setting. This also breaks chromeOS updates.
OmadaDNS is an AdGuard Home DNS server running with a blocklist. It has no logs, and it uses Quad9 upstream.

Notes:
-> If your school has "Managed networks" on, use cauDNS.

Instructions:
1. Go to your settings.
2. Click on the wifi name you are using and click it again.
3. Go to the 'Network' section and click it.
4. Scroll down until you find the 'Name servers' section.
5. Change the option to 'Custom Name Servers'.
6. Set the first field to 66.23.198.252, the second field to 66.94.105.229, the third field to 167.86.91.171, and the fourth to 0.0.0.0
7. Refresh your network connection by turning your wifi off and on.

Issues:
-> GoGuardian is patching this soon with a hardcoded list. Common sites like Discord will stay blocked, but you will still be able to use about any proxy link.
-> Lightspeed keeps a cache for two weeks of blocked websites. Simply use the DNS for more than two weeks. It might also work if you clear the cache for all time in chrome://settings/clearBrowserData, and ensuring cache is selected and time is all time.
-> This does NOT work on filters such as ContentKeeper, iboss, most Cisco configurations, or FortiGuard. They are network level.
-> If you're already using OmadaDNS, continue to do so, and DO NOT connect to a wifi network without it, unless your extensions may update and be patched.
-> This commonly breaks locked mode quizzes. To fix them, revert the DNS, reboot your Chromebook, go to chrome://policy and press "refresh policies".

Troubleshooting:
-> If pages load indefinitely or error out, set Wi‑Fi as the primary network and perform a hard restart (press Refresh + Power at the same time).
-> If pages start to randomly get blocked, go back to the network settings where you entered the DNS addresses and select Automatic name servers.
-> Wait a few seconds, then disconnect and reconnect to the Wi‑Fi network.
-> Switch back to Custom name servers, re‑enter the DNS addresses in the correct fields, and perform another hard restart (Refresh + Power).
