Proton VPN on ChromeOS
Note: This relies on you being below chromeOS version 129.

Instructions:
1. Create or log into a proton VPN account by going to this website: https://account.protonvpn.com/signup
2. Once you have an account, go to Account -> OpenVPN / IKEv2 username.
3. Copy the username and password.
4. Unzip the files and choose any server that you want to use (like us-19 or s/t).
5. Edit it in the Text editor app (it’s a built-in chrome app on Chromebook) or any other text editor.
6. All the way at the end, after “TLSAuthContents”: “-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----, put in
   ,
          "Username": "(Put your username here)",
          "Password": "(Put your password here)"

You can just copy and paste it and you’ll get the right formatting. Make sure that you start the paste right after the end quotation mark.
7. Save the onc file.
8. Upload it to chrome://network#general all the way at the bottom where it says Import ONC File 
(don’t worry if you don’t notice anything, just try scrolling down a little more and it should say Networks imported: 1 (regardless of how many you actualy imported)
