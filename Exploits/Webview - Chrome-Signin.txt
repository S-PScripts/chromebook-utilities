Notes:
If you get this error...
"This account is not allowed to sign in within this network.
Please talk to your network administrator for more information."
... you can't perform this exploit (I can't either :P).

Here's an alternative way:
1. Go to chrome://add-supervision.
   If it is a blank screen, do CTRL + SHIFT + R.
2. Enter your school email and your password.
3. It should load and it should say:
"You don't have access to this service. To request access, contact the administrator for your organizationâ€™s Google services."
4. Press administrator. It should load a google policy page.
5. Scroll all the way down and press Privacy Policy.
6. Scroll all the way down and press Google.
