CORMADA  
An exploit inspired from Sh1ttyoobe and Corkey which uses OmadaDNS to allow you to be enterprise enrolled, without any blocking or tracking extensions!

Requirements:
- Unblocked Internet with permission to change nameservers (Home or School Guest Network)
- A brain

Features:
- No tracking or blocking extensions
- The ability to change and/or customise your wallpaper settings
- Even more...?

HOW TO DO THE EXPLOIT
- Powerwash (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R) or go to dev mode and back
- Connect to internet (DO NOT PRESS GET STARTED)
- Set DNS servers to 66.23.198.252 and 66.94.105.229 (do this on all networks)
- Set up Chromebook normally
- Profit

Tested for:
- Chromebooks with "Securly for chromebooks" and "securly classroom" (blockers)
- The history logger/tracker "learnplatform"

FAQ:
Q: Will this work if I connect to a wifi network without the custom nameservers or if I change them back to automatic?
A: No, it will not. Your organization's policies will automatically be applied, as well as the blocking extensions and spyware.
