CORMADA  
An exploit inspired from Sh1ttyOOBE and Corkey which uses OmadaDNS to allow you to be enterprise enrolled, without any blocking or tracking extensions!

Requirements:
- Unblocked Internet with permission to change nameservers (Home or School Guest Network)
- A brain

Features:
- No tracking or blocking extensions
- The ability to change and/or customise your wallpaper settings
- Even more...?

Instructions:
First of all,
1. Powerwash (CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R) or go to Dev mode and back.
2. Connect to the Internet (DO NOT PRESS GET STARTED).
OR 
1. Sign out of your Chromebook.
2. Click the down arrow next to your name, press "Remove account", and confirm.

Afterwards,
1. Find Quick Settings, go to your Wi-Fi network, click the "Network" dropdown, scroll down until you find the "Name Servers" area.
2. Click the Custom Name Servers area and enter these in the same order:
1st box: 66.94.105.229
2nd box: 66.23.198.252 
3rd box: 0.0.0.0
4th box: 0.0.0.0
3. Disconnect and reconnect to the network.
4. Sign in to your account again.

FAQ:
Q: Will this work if I connect to a Wi-Fi network without the custom name servers or if I change them back to automatic?
A: No, it will not. Your organisation's policies will automatically be applied, as well as the blocking extensions and spyware.
