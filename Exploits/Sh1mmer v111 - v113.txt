The Fog (Google's response to sh1mmer, and why this might not be working for you):
-> Downgrading and unenrollment has been patched by Google. 
-> If your Chromebook has never updated to version 112 before (check in chrome://version), you can ignore this and follow the regular instructions. 
-> If not, unenrollment will not work as normal. 
-> If you aren't willing to take apart your Chromebook to unenroll, you can use an affiliated project, E-HALCYON to boot into a deprovisioned environment temporarily.

How to use SH1MMER on v111 → v113 (if you're willing to take the back cover off your Chromebook):
-> You only need to do this once, and it will let you use SH1MMER even after it's been completely patched.

1. Unplug everything, open the back panel, disconnect the battery to disable WP, plug in the charger

2. Boot into SH1MMER and use "Un-Enroll / Deprovision" (yes it will show an error, but that doesn't matter)
(you will also need to run "Disable block_devmode" if you're using the old legacy version)

3. Go to the bash shell and run this command: 
/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090

Do not use "Reset GBB Flags" after this.

4. Exit SH1MMER, unplug everything, reconnect the battery, and reconnect the charger.

5. Boot up and press Ctrl+D to enter developer mode.

6. When completed, use Ctrl+ALT+SHIFT+R to powerwash

7. After powerwashing, immediately enter VT2 with Ctrl+Alt+F2 (→), login as "root" and run these commands:
tpm_manager_client take_ownership
cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters

If it fails, try downgrading to v110 if possible. If you can't, use E-Halycon instead.

8. Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 (←), and use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R to powerwash again.

NOTE: If you have a dedede board, your WP method is probably different. Look your model up online to find the WP method.
