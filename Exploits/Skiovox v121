Skiovox (v121):

Instructions:
1. Sign out.
2. Type your password in (don't enter).
3. click esc + shift + alt + r.
4. Click "cancel" (don't powerwash your Chromebook).
5. Do normal Skiovox [Turning off wifi|Going into the kiosk app|Alt + shift + s'ing|Going to accessibility [question mark]).

These next steps have to be fast:
6. Click "Add wifi" then spam esc.
7. Click "Add other person" and spam esc.

Notes:
-> This only works if you have your gmail saved into your chromebook. When you sign out, your pfp would be there and you would only need to type your password. 
   If it shows usernames and photos on the sign-in screen, your gmail is saved.
