HWID better unenrollment (escape the tsunami renewed)

You can use HWID for a more persistent and easier  way to stay unenrolled rather than escape the tsunami and stuff like that, even though most recommend against changing your HWID. 
This is better because you don’t have to go through that tedious process of unenrolling in shimmer, entering dev mode, powerwashing and entering those commands every single time. 
This makes unenrolling and reenrolling extremely easy once properly setup.

Instructions:
1. Turn write protection off (figure it out yourself).
2. Change your HWID to a malformed one (like appending a -DEV on your preexisting hwid or anything else in general). You can use the MrChromeBox payload in sh1mmer if you don’t know the 
manual commands (BadApple can work if you know the manual commands) and it is recommended that you set your GBB flags after that as well for Developer mode and such.
3. Recover to an any image (doesn’t matter).
4. It will say factory error malformed HWID, don’t worry about that. Press skip for now. You know you have done it right if there isn’t any get started screen. If there is one, you have done it wrong.
5. Connect to a wifi and login with your personal account to set the chromebook up.
6. Once you are logged in, sign out using ctrl+shift+qq, after that you will be placed on a get started screen.
7. Go through OOBE as normal, after you press continue on wifi, it will try to enroll you but it won’t be able to. While it's loading, do an EC restart (refresh+power). 
After it restarts, you should be on a screen where you can sign in to the personal account you used to setup your chromebook previously.
8. Whenever you want to re-enroll (only if it's allowed by policy but about 95% do), powerwash your chromebook. 
Follow the steps stated above as normal but instead of choosing personal account, choose enterprise enrollment and login with your school email.
9. Make sure to revert your HWID to your previous when handing your chromebook back to your school.
