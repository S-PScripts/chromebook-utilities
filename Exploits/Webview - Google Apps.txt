Webview - Google Apps

Notes before you start:
-> This is a new exploit BUT it's really stupid. 
-> It utilises a bug that is very very dumb, and Google still haven't noticed it. As you can see, there are grammar errors I'm too lazy to fix.
-> You must have the Play Store app for each of them in order to use the webview. If you cannot download them, go cry.
-> Go to the URL matching your app and copy the file, including the Apps script. Then, follow the instructions on the sheet.
-> Open the things, make a copy of them, then open in the Play Store app.
