E414 - Unblock websites via Among Us

Notes:
-> Works on GoGuardian

Instructions:
-> Create the incrapped url (https://<acraptonofamongusemojishere>@websiteyouwanttogoto)
For example: https://<abunchofamongusemojishere>@slope.ee
-> Visit it.

Notes:
-> If it shows error 414/request too large/ something like that, then you don't have enough emojis.
-> Refreshing the site does NOT block it (hard reloading does though).
