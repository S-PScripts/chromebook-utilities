This is an exploit that allows for access to sites outside of the Hapara Focus Session.

Instructions:
1. Create a bookmark named anything, head to the URL section, and paste this in it:
data:text/html,<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>full screen iframe</title> <style type="text/css"> html { overflow: auto; } html, body, div, iframe { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; height: 100%; border: none; } iframe { display: block; width: 100%; border: none; overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden; } </style> </head> <body> <iframe src="https://www.google.com" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" width="100%" height="100%" scrolling="auto" id="google"> </iframe> </body> </html>
2. When you are in a focus session, click the bookmark, and it will open a Google tab. 
3. Enjoy not having to listen to a lecture from your teacher!

Notes:
Your teacher may be able to see your screen still, but they won't think you are doing anything wrong because of the focus session.
YOU MUST NEED data: LINKS ALLOWED, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE ALLOWED, THIS WILL NOT WORK.

-> If the code at the top doesn't work, then you can download the Iframe and open it from your computer:
