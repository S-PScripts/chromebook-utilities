This is a chrome://sign-in webview (exploit) for people that get "This account is not allowed to sign in within this network." if they try to put in a personal email.

-> You will need to be able to connect to EE Wifi.

Instructions

Keep reloading the page until the sign in page DOESN'T immediately show a "Connect to EE Wifi". It should load for a while instead of saying "Connect to EE Wifi".
