Tr3nch - run scripts in Chrome pages with SKIOVOX Breakout and Sh0vel!
Sh0vel is necessary for Tr3nch to perform most of its functions.

Finding Sh0vel - Instructions:

Check installed extensions:
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions.
2. Check if any installed extensions contain the "Read your browsing history" permission.
   -> Find an extension to check.
   -> Click Details in the extension card.

If necessary extensions are not installed:
1. Navigate to the Chrome Web Store. (https://chromewebstore.google.com/)
2. Find an extension that contains the "Read your browsing history" permission.
3. Navigate to the extension's Chrome Web Store details page.
4. Click Add to Chrome.

Get the extension ID:
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions.
2. Open the details page of the extension you installed.
3. Copy the 32-character extension ID from the address bar after ?id=.

1. Navigate to the manifest page of the extension you installed. (chrome-extension://extension_id_here/manifest.json)
2. Check if one of the following text occurrences (no quotes!) are present in the manifest file.
- "activeTab"
- "unsafe-eval" (NOT wasm-unsafe-eval, that WILL NOT WORK!)
- "browser_action" or "browserAction"
You can press Ctrl + F and enter one of the strings provided in this step to check.
3. If all of the previously listed text occurrences are present in the manifest file, that's great! 
The extension you're checking is vulnerable to Sh0vel! Use this extension when continuing with the guide.
