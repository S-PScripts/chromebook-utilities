Bypass GoGuardian's tab limit!

Notes:
-> Teachers can still see your screen, but they can't block or close any of your tabs.
-> YOUR TEACHER NEEDS TO HAVE SET A TAB LIMIT. TRY OPENING TONS OF TABS TO CONVINCE THEM TO ENABLE TAB LIMITS.
-> If you can't install extensions, you can't do this exploit.

Extension:
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/read-aloud-a-text-to-spee/hdhinadidafjejdhmfkjgnolgimiaplp

Instructions:
1. Download the extension linked above.
2. Use one of your tabs to go to IReady or Scratch. You just need a site that would display the error 
when you close the tab "Are you sure you want to close this site? Unsaved changes could be lost."
3. When you have the site with unsaved changes, click the extension until you see the error. Click cancel on the error.
4. The extension should have opened some tabs which say: "Read Aloud uses this tab for audio playback."
5. If you saw the error and clicked cancel, you should have bypassed the tab limit.
