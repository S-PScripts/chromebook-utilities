Shim Wifi
- This is a writeup on how to put wifi in a normal ChromeOS RMA Shim.

How it works:
Basically, you just put the linux firmware in the RMA Shim while or after building. It's quite simple, but not documented well in the slightest.

bash
git clone --depth=1 https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/linux-firmware
rm -rf $(find ./linux-firmware/* -not -name "iwlwifi*.ucode")
cp -r ./linux-firmware/* $wherever_your_shim_is/lib/firmware/ 


In a typical shim running the SH1MMER-ed rootfs, all you have to do to get the wifi device active is put something along the lines of this in whatever file runs in the shim.

bash
rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
mkdir -p /run/dbus
dbus-daemon --system > /dev/null 2>&1
mkdir -p /var/lib
modprobe -r iwlwifi
modprobe iwlwifi
