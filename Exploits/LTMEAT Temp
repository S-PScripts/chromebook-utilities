This is Temp LTMEAT.

Extension page: chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/manifest.json
Extension background: chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/background.js
Extension settings: chrome://extensions/?id=<extensionidhere>
To get the ID, just go to chrome://extensions/ and find the blocking extension. Click on details and copy the part in the URL after ?id=

Instructions:
1. Create a bookmark as the extension settings page and name it Kill switch.
2. Create a new bookmark folder. Name it spam.js. 
3. Add the extension background page into the folder.
3. Right click the folder and click Bookmark Manager.
4. Click the extension background page.
5. Do CTRL+C and CTRL+V until you have 38 extension background pages bookmarked.
6. Go to a new tab.
7. Right click the folder you made.
8. Click Open All(38).
9. Repeat step 3 to 8. Click one of the tabs from this batch. 
10. Wait until the This page is taking too long popup appears. This will take 30-60 seconds. 
If it doesnâ€™t, do chrome://restart, go back to the bookmark manager and add 3-4 more pages.
11. Once the popup happens, right-click on one of the tabs closest to the right of the screen and hit Duplicate. 
12. Go to your Kill switch bookmark and flip the Allow Access to File:// urls switch.
13. Click on the leftmost extension tab (one that opened from the spam.js folder) and click Close all tabs to the right. KEEP THIS TAB OPEN!
14. With this workaround, LTMEAT can endure a longer life!

Tips:
Go to chrome://settings/performance and turn Memory Saver off.
In the box where it says Keep these sites always active, paste in the extension URL. 
Clicking on one of the tabs from the second batch seems to help with reliability.
