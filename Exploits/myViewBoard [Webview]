This webview was found by me!

Discovery:
-> My school had the App Store but obviously you couldn't download any apps... except for one random one called "myViewBoard WhiteBoard", a digital mini whiteboard for students as an alternative to the real ones.
-> This was probably something for teachers to use with us students, but most teachers didn't use whiteboards and the teachers that did use a whiteboard used actual ones or Google Canvas.
-> So I downloaded this app but I never took a close look at it - I never really checked for any webviews.
-> I did take a look for webviews on an app called ASR. This was auto-installed and couldn't be uninstalled. I don't know why the school even had this app since I think it had even less
point of existing than the whiteboard in our school.
-> There were no webviews in ASR so I kept using proxies and moved on with my life.
-> Except one day I saw Blobby-Boi in a 3kh0 discussion with a list of webviews. This made me thinking about the chance myViewBoard had one.
-> So I checked... and well there was one. A great one too with a whole window GUI!
-> Enough of me rambling now, here are the steps.

Instructions:
1. Go to this link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viewsonic.droid&hl=en&gl=US
2. Download it. If you can't then you cannot use this exploit. 
3. Open the app.
4. Click "Let's sign up!" on the sign up window. It will open a MyViewBoard sign up page.
5. Open a new tab in the app. It will open a different MyViewBoard page but you can ignore this.
--> Extra note: On this MyViewBoard page, you can click the google icon to log in to your personal google account.
6. Put any link in the search box (for example, https://discord.com - also you will need the https://) and click enter. 
If there isn't adjust the tab window with the squares in the bottom right. Or alternatively, click the icon between the "-" and the "X".
--> You can also put a term and it will search the term with google too! For example, put discord and it will search discord.
7. Profit.

Notes:
-> If you closed the sign up window then you can click the icon in the bottom right to reopen it.
-> Nothing shows in your history!

Issues:
It's a bit slow at loading pages and crashes sometimes.
The CTRL key and some others do not work.
