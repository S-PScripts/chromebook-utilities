Skiovox for chromeOS v141

Open a Skiovox window: https://skiovox141.crosbreaker.dev/open

Instructions:
1. Find a website kiosk (one that shows the URL while it's loading).
2. Find some way to navigate away from the main page and to a search engine, like Google.
3. After getting on Google (or any search engine), find some sort of text field (most likely the search bar).
4. In the text field, type the following HTML:           <script>window.open("javascript:alert();");</script>            <- Copy it to the clipboard.
5. Go to a Real-time HTML editor (https://htmledit.squarefree.com/)
6. Paste the HTML you copied and it should open a Chrome window.
