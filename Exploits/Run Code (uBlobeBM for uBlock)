uBlobeBM is a tool that can run bookmarklets using uBlock Origin. It's very useful if bookmarklets don't work on your device or if they are blocked by your administrator.

How to setup uBlobeBM:
-> Make sure that you have uBlock Origin installed on your computer. If you dont, download it at https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm.
-> Go to chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/advanced-settings.html
-> Find userResourcesLocation and change it from unset to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blobby-Boi/uBlobeBM/refs/heads/main/blob.js
-> Go to chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/1p-filters.html
-> Add the following line of code: *##+js(blob.js)

How to use uBlobeBM:
-> Press CTRL + Shift + ~
-> Where it says "Enter bookmarklet here", enter the bookmarklet code. Then click on the green "Add Bookmarklet" button.
-> It will prompt you for how you want it to be called. Name it something that makes sense, because once you have a long list of bookmarklets you want it to be easy to tell which one's which.
-> Once you enter the name, you should see the bookmarklet show up. It consists of 4 buttons: The blue button is to run the bookmarklet, the red button is to remove the bookmarklet, 
and the other 2 buttons are to rename the bookmarklet and edit the bookmarklet. Hovering over the blue button for a few seconds reveals the bookmarklet code.
-> You can add as many bookmarklets as you need onto uBlobeBM. The bookmarklets will save even if you close the window or shut down your device.
