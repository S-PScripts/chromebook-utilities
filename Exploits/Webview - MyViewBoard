myviewboard-exploit
This webview was found by me, S-PScripts.

Discovery:
-> My school had the Play Store but obviously you couldn’t download any apps… except for one random one called “myViewBoard WhiteBoard”, a digital mini whiteboard for students as an alternative to the real ones.

-> This was probably something for teachers to use with us students, but most teachers didn’t use whiteboards and the teachers that did use a whiteboard used actual ones or Google Canvas.

-> I downloaded myViewBoard but I never took a close look at it - I never really checked for any webviews.

-> I did take a look for webviews on an app called ASR. This was auto-installed and couldn’t be uninstalled. I don’t know why the school even had this app since in my opinion it had even less point of existing than the whiteboard in our school.

-> There were no webviews in ASR (that I could find at the time, I did find one later: https://github.com/s-pscripts/asr-exploit/) so I kept using proxies and moved on with my life.

-> However, one day I saw Blobby-Boi in a 3kh0 discussion with a list of webviews. This made me think about the chance myViewBoard had one.

-> After this, I checked the app again… and very quickly I found that there was one! One with a whole window GUI!

-> Enough of me rambling now, here are the instructions.

Instructions:
Go to the download page for myViewBoard here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viewsonic.droid&hl=en&gl=US
Install myViewBoard. If you can’t, you cannot do this exploit.
Open myViewBoard.
Click “Let’s sign up!” on the sign up window. It will open a MyViewBoard sign up page.
Open a new tab in the app. It will open a different MyViewBoard page but you can ignore this.
-> Extra note: On this MyViewBoard page, you can click the Google icon to log in to your personal Google account.
Put any link in the search box (for example, https://discord.com - also you will need the https://) and click enter.
If there isn’t adjust the tab window with the squares in the bottom right. Or alternatively, click the icon between the “-“ and the “X”.
-> You can also put a term and it will search the term with Google too! For example, put discord and it will search discord.
Profit.
Notes:
-> If you closed the sign up window then you can click the icon in the bottom right to reopen it.
-> Nothing shows in your history!

Issues:
-> It’s a bit slow at loading pages and crashes sometimes.
-> The CTRL key and some others do not work.

PS: My school removed myViewBoard so I can’t give more information on this webview anymore.
