Securly is good at blocking but there is a simple bypass!

Instructions:
1. Go to the blocked site you want to access
2. Once it shows the blocked page, copy the URL it shows in the URL bar.
3. Open a new tab and paste the link into the URL bar.
4. Delete everything between https:// and the first "?"
5. Click the enter key.
6. It should be blocked, now have fun!

If it works for you, you should make the most of it until it gets patched...
