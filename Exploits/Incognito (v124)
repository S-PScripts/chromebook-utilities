6. Go to Settings.
7. Click Wifi in the Network section.
8. Click your wifi.
9. Click Network.
10. Set Name servers to Custom name servers.
11. Set the first box to detectportal.firefox.com.
12. A sign in pop up should appear from your wifi. Click Sign in.
13. Do CTRL+T - YOU'RE NOW IN INCOGNITO MODE!
14. Set Name servers back to what it was before.

Notes:
-> Extensions can't block you! 
-> No search history! 

You can use CAUB to allow changing DNS/Name servers if policies like:

{
   "NetworkConfigurations": [ {
      "GUID": "{<redacted>}",
      "Name": "<redacted>",
      "ProxySettings": {
         "Type": "Direct"
      },
      "Type": "WiFi",
      "WiFi": {
         "AutoConnect": true,
         "HiddenSSID": false,
         "Passphrase": "<redacted>",
         "SSID": "<redacted>",
         "Security": "WPA-PSK"
      }
   } ]
}

https://github.com/s0urce-c0de for finding the post, writing the original writeup on 3kh0's repo and adding CAUB to my writeup
https://github.com/S-PScripts (me) for finding a DNS that opens a captive portal window and writing this writeup
https://github.com/jee1mr/captive-portal because that's where I found the DNS

Weird thing:
I did this exploit and I noticed when I checked my windows that the OLD sign in window exploit thing was there (v105). I had tried using its DNS to get a captive window but it didn't work since it was down.
But apparently not. What was weird was that I hadn't even got a sign in pop up. I got one when I used the firefox one, but that opened a different captive tab. That tab wasn't there, so maybe the two DNS merged?
