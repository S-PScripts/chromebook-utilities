This is a rough guide to unenrolling on Grunt Treeya.

Requirements:
-> kernver 2 or below - chromeOS v119 or below

Instructions:
1. Downgrade to v112.
2. Use CryptoSmite normally. It will error but be in a weird state half-enrolled, where it will be unenrolled until you powerwash.
3. Use a modified shim (such as SH1MMER) to switch to kernver 0 or 1.
4. Downgrade to a ChromeOS version below 101.
5. Do the ancient CoolElectronics unenroll method at https://github.com/S-PScripts/chromebook-utilities/blob/main/Exploits/Unenrollment%20(Crosh)%20(to%20v100)
6. Enjoy!
