probably the least viable exploit here
So... your school blocked the SSH on your terminal huh? Well you can bypass it here.

EZ bypass:
1. Open terminal and set the SSH up (you cannot connect to it tho)
2. Close the terminal app
3. Right click the terminal icon on the launcher
4. Click the SSH you want to open
5. profit

idk if this was posted elsewhere
