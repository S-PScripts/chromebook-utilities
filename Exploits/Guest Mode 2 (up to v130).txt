Guest Mode 2 (up to v130)

Instructions:
1. Powerwash your Chromebook.
2. During setup, select a wifi network that opens a captive portal.
3. Your Chromebook usually gets stuck on a loading screen for a few seconds up to 5 mins. Just wait.
4. Wait for a captive portal popup that has a URL bar at the top. It has to be the one with the URL bar.
5. Click the URL once to highlight it, then right-click it once. This should make the screen turn black for a few seconds (for some reason).
6. Close the portal. On the network list, there should be a little link that will open guest mode.
