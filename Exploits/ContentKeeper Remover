Remove ContentKeeper permanently, as long as you don't powerwash again after this exploit.

Instructions:
1. Sign Out with ctrl + shift + q + q.
2. When the login screen pops up, powerwash with ctrl + alt + shift + r.
3. Sign in as normal. 
4. When you log in disconnect from your wifi. This prevents ContentKeeper from installing automatically.
5. Navigate to settings, go to apps and manage your google play preferences (If that is not there, it has not installed. Turn your wifi on until that installs).
6. Click android settings, apps, All apps, scroll down a little to google play store, click it, then press disable.
6. After play store is disabled, you can turn your wifi on again.
