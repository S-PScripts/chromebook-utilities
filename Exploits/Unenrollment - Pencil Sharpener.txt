Pencil Sharpener
This exploit is for non-factory keyrolled Ti50 systems only, meaning that your Chromebook had its shim keys changed in an update and not during its assembly.

CAUTION: DURING THE EXPLOIT, MAKE SURE THE CHROMEBOOK STAYS PLUGGED INTO A CHARGER AT ALL TIMES (EXCEPT WHILE BRIDGING THE WP PINS). OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM MAY BRICK
Note: Google changed how Pencil Sharpener can be used from chromeOS v136. Pwerwashing your device even after it has been unenrolled will require you to redo the exploit. 
As a result, switching to other release channels (beta, canary) is impossible. This write-up exists only for educational purposes. Please do not damage or tamper with a system that does not belong to you.

Pencil Sharpener is an exploit that allows users to unenroll non-factory keyrolled Ti50 Chromebooks through a modified version of the pencil method. 
This works because the Google Security Chip does not verify device hashes until the system completely loses power, allowing users to temporarily bypass validation checks and disable RO verification.

You can watch the proof of concept video on Odysee if you need a visual demonstration of the exploit: https://ody.sh/xySDCFhvHi

Requirements:
- SOIC-8 or WSON-8 chip clip
- Paperclip or Safety Pin
- Linux system with flashrom installed
- A screwdriver
- Sh1mmer image for your board
- Working charger
- Ch341a Flash Programmer
- A ChromeOS recovery USB for v124

Recommended kit (SOIC-8): https://www.amazon.com/AiTrip-EEPROM-Programmer-CH341A-Adapter/dp/B07VNVVXW6
Recommended kit (WSON-8): https://a.co/d/5dswJ8O

Instructions:
- First, fully power off and unplug your device, flip it over, and open the back to access the mainboard.

- Take your chip clip, and a safety pin (recommended) or paperclip. If you are using a safety pin, cut off the bigger side.
- Put the paperclip or safety pin into holes 3 and 8. To find these, find the red wire. This is pin 1. From there, you can find the other pins. 
  With pin 1 in the top left, pin 3 would be the 3rd pin in the top row, and pin 8 would be directly under pin 1.

- Then, disconnect the battery and locate your Flash Chip. Bridge pins 3 and 8.

- Flip your laptop to its side with the charging port facing up and the pins still bridged.
- Plug in your device and push ESC + Refresh + Power to enter the device recovery menu, then press CTRL + D.
- As soon as the screen goes black, press ESC + Refresh + Power again.

- Insert your Sh1mmer USB and boot onto it. You may get a no valid image error. If this happens, you need to re-flash the correct keys to the device using instructions in the rolled keys section.

- After booting into Sh1mmer, you should choose Utilities -> Unenroll. It should give an error. Open the bash console WHILE MAKING SURE THE PINS ARE STILL BRIDGED and run:
flashrom --wp-disable
/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x80b3
flashrom --wp-enable

IMPORTANT: On newer versions, if you get an error saying "owner has disabled downgrading" or "verified images only" you must disable rootfs verification in sh1mmer.

- Hit ESC + Refresh + Power and boot onto your v124 recovery USB. If you have any issues before or after the recovery process, follow the rolled keys steps.

- After the recovery is complete, boot into ChromeOS. On the sign-in screen, switch to VT2 by pressing CTRL + ALT + F2.

- If you are prompted to login on the console, try to log in as chronos with no password, and elevate to root by using sudo -i. 
  If that does not work, you can try logging in as root and then using test0000 as your password. After you have access to the shell, run the following commands:
tpm_manager_client take_ownership
cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters
crossystem dev_boot_usb=1

- Reconnect the battery to the motherboard, and run gsctool -a -o. Follow the prompts to push the power button and the system should automatically reboot. 
- When the device turns back on, re-open the recovery menu and re-enable devmode.

- Afterwards, go back to the VT2 console, run gsctool -a -I AllowUnverifiedRo:always, and the device should be unenrolled.

Fixing Rolled Keys:
IMPORTANT: THIS WILL NOT UNROLL FACTORY ROLLED KEYS!! While using Pencil Sharpener, you may be unable to boot onto Sh1mmer or your recovery USB. 
This is because your system's shim keys have been changed in an update.

This issue is fixed by re-flashing the correct keys to the system. Here's how to do it:
- First, take your ch341a flash programmer and attach it to your chip clip (the red wire connects to number 1 on the ch341a). 
- Take the end of your chip clip, and re-attach it to your flash chip. Now, connect using your Linux system and run the following commands:
flashrom --wp-disable
futility gbb -p ch341a_spi -r file.bin
futility gbb -p ch341a_spi -s -r file.bin
flashrom --wp-enable

Re-Enrolling
You can re-enroll your device by accessing a VT2 shell, typing vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=1, and then powerwashing the device using CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R.
