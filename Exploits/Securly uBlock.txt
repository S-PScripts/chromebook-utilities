You must be able to install uBlock Origin to do this.

Steps:
1. Install the uBlock Origin extension.
2. Set up uRun.
3. Go to https://securly.com and click Ctrl + Shift + ` (It will say blocked but it's fine)
-> DO NOT CLOSE THE OPENED WINDOW!
4. Remove uRun and set up uBlock Run.
5. Copy the code from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zek-c/Securly-Kill-V111/refs/heads/main/kill.js
6. Go back to https://securly.com and click Ctrl + Shift + ` again. The prompt will open in the blocked uRun window, but that is how it should work.
7. Paste the code you copied into the eval prompt and click enter.
8. A big red OFF button should show up. Click off to kill the extension.
