You must be able to install uBlock Origin to do this.

Steps:
1. Install the uBlock Origin extension. uBlock Origin Lite DOES NOT WORK!
2. Set up uRun.
3. Go to https://securly.com and click Ctrl + Shift + ` (It will say blocked but it's fine)
-> DO NOT CLOSE THE OPENED WINDOW!
4. Remove uRun and set up uBlock Run.
5. Copy the code from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zek-c/Securly-Kill-V111/refs/heads/main/kill.js
6. Go back to https://securly.com and click Ctrl + Shift + ` again. The prompt will open in the blocked uRun window, but that is how it should work.
7. Paste the code you copied into the eval prompt and click enter.
8. A big red OFF button should show up. Click off to kill the extension.

Alternate steps for those who cannot get uBlock Origin:
1. Install the Run Javascript Extension https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/run-javascript/lmilalhkkdhfieeienjbiicclobibjao and pin it
2. Go to https://securly.com
3. Click the Run Javascript extension
4. Write window.open() and click execute
5. Copy the code from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zek-c/Securly-Kill-V111/refs/heads/main/kill.js
6. In the about:blank page that was opened, click the Run Javascript extension, paste the code that you copied and press execute
7. Click the big red OFF button
8. Securly should be disabled
