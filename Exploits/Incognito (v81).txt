Make sure to downgrade to chromeOS v81 or lower first before doing this exploit!

Steps to the Incognito Exploit:

Getting Started:
1. Get on the login screen to the part where you are signing in as a new user. 
2. Enter your email and password but don't login. 
3. Do Alt + Shift + I. 

Instructions: 
1. Once it gets to the "Privacy Policy" part, spam it for a minute or 30 seconds (until it is very laggy).
2. Once you log in, go quickly to the Incognito Tab and do Ctrl+Shift+N.
3. Use the Switch/Desktop View key and close the original Incognito tab.
4. If it continues to open policy pages, repeat Step 3.

Benefits:
-> No extensions so you won't have to worry about anything being blocked by an extension.
-> Access to a fully unrestricted YouTube.
-> Ability to sign into other google accounts. (if blocked)
-> Be able to access the majority of chrome:// urls if they were blocked by policy.
-> Get past policy blocks. (untested fully but certain sites that were blocked by policy were unblocked for some people.)
-> Use flags to further experiment with your chromebook. This applies to chrome:// urls being unblocked.
-> Access to an "experimental" unblocked chrome. (called experimental as it is both restricted and not restricted.)

Possible issues you may encounter:
-> When importing an onc file, you might crash.
-> Don't go to chrome://os-settings or try to view Settings from the Incognito tab.
-> Restarting to modify flags will close the tab, however the effects will be applied when you restart.
-> When importing an extension (unpacked or entire crx), you will encounter the error "not allowed on login screen".
