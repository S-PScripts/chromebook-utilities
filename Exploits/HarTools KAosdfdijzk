HarTools - Developer Tools code execution post-RigTools patch <chromeOS v133

Explanation:
- This uses a vulnerability in .har files to open a javascript: URL and execute code on devtools://devtools
- Not only does this allow us to gain access to the DevTools API, but it also allows for code execution in extensions (like RigTools).

Instructions:
1. Download HARTOOLS.har: https://github.com/crossjbly/HarTools/releases/latest/download/HARTOOLS.har
2. Get the file HARTOOLS.har onto the device you want to run the devtools XSS on.
3. On the device you want to run the devtools XSS on, go to devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html
4. Once it loads, add ?experiments=true to the end of the URL.
5. On the sidebar on the inspector page at the top, click the 2 arrows (looks like: >>) and select network from the dropdown.
    ^^^ If you are already on the network page, you can skip this ^^^
6. Click the little upload button and select the downloaded HARTOOLS.HAR.
    ^^^ You may need to expand the sidebar to see it ^^^
7. Double click on the text that appears in the box.

If devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html is blocked for you:
    Substitute inspector.html with any of the following:
        js_app.html
        devtools_app.html
        worker_app.html

Creating your own payloads:
- Clone the repo using git clone https://github.com/crossjbly/HarTools.git, then cd into the directory using cd HarTools
- Make any changes you want to the HTML, or JS files.
- Run autoxss.py [https://github.com/crossjbly/HarTools/blob/main/autoxss.py] with python autoxss.py
- Head over to the generator [https://hartools.vercel.app/hartools/generator.html] and paste the contents of autoxss.js
(If this is down, use the data page url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crossjbly/HarTools/refs/heads/main/generator-datapage.txt)

Notes:
- This does not work on v133 and some versions of v132.
- This will work without internet because everything is included in the main payload run.
