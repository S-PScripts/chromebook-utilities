This only seems to work for Discord and Youtube but it might work for others.

Method 1:
Open this in a new tab: 
data:text/html,<script>window.location.href='https://discord.com/app?%27+%27e%27.repeat(16380)%3C/script%3E
-> Edit the number in repeat() if it isn't working
-> To go to different websites, change the link between href=' and ?

Method 2:
Bookmark this and open in a new tab:
javascript:window.open('https://discord.com/app?'+'e'.repeat(16384));
-> Edit the number in repeat() if it isn't working
-> To go to different websites, change the link between open(' and '+'e'

Method 3 (BEST):
Schoolexploitkid decided to make this exploit into a website, along with a few other exploits as well.
