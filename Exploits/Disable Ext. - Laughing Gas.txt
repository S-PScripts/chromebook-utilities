Laughing Gas - Disable extensions

Disclaimers:
-> If you do it wrong, it WILL hang your website loader and you will need to restart your Chromebook.
-> Sites may load VERY slowly because of this.
-> If someone finds a way to combine this with LTMEAT flood or finds a better way of killing the extension, use that instead.

This is Anesthesia but without removing the web listeners/the switch because many schools block it.
This exploit was made for people with chrome://extensions disabled (and that's most).

This works on most recent versions (including v124 and v125). 

Setup (before doing the exploit):
1. Bookmark the largest file of the extension you want to hang. If you want to know how to find your largest file, go look in any other guide first.
2. Change your print settings to make the largest amount of pages possible (increase the margins, increase font size, etc.).
3. Sign out.

FOR PEOPLE ABLE TO TOGGLE INTERNET ON THE SIGN-IN SCREEN:
1. Sign in without internet.
2. Open a new tab.
3. Click the bookmark you made.
4. Wait for it to close. Then open a new tab, ctrl+click the bookmark, then click the bookmark. If you did this right, the extension page should have two tabs.
5. Press Ctrl+P on one of them.
6. Reload the one that you did step 5 on.
7. Duplicate it.
8. Wait for the pop-up that says that the tab is not loading.
9. Press ctrl+shift+w.
10. Turn your internet back on.
11. Profit.

FOR PEOPLE UNABLE TO TOGGLE INTERNET ON THE SIGN-IN SCREEN:
1. Sign in.
2. Turn off internet.
3. Open a new tab, ctrl+click the bookmark, then click the bookmark. If you did this right, the extension page should have two tabs.
4. Press Ctrl+P on one of them.
5. Refresh both tabs.
6. Wait for the pop-up that says that the tab is not loading. 
7. Click Ok (the thing that kills the tab).
8. The tab should now be killed. 
9. Reload both tabs.
10. Press ctrl+p on one of them.
11. Duplicate the one you did step 10 on.
12. Wait for the pop-up that says that the tab is not loading.
13. Press ctrl+shift+w.
14. Turn your internet back on.
15. Profit.
