Locked Mode Bypass - gambitin
Works on v129, patched by v131

If you just hold ESC + the brightness down button for a bit or retap it a few times and hold, you will get unlocked.
Sometimes, it will lock you again. If so, repeat the steps above. You'll be unlocked again after a bit.
Note: ALT TAB to open windows, DO NOT CLICK THEM.
