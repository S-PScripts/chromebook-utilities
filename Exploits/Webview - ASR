ASR Webview:

Notes:
-> ASR was one of the two apps our school allowed from the Play Store, the other being myViewboard WhiteBoard. Unlike myViewboard, ASR was force-installed without any way to uninstall it.
-> I knew that this app had to have a webview somewhere. I had tried finding it for quite a bit but couldn't find any... but I eventually found it! At 11:00pm...

Instructions:
1. Go to the download page for ASR here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.asr&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_medium%3Dhome-page
2. Install ASR. If you can't, you cannot do this exploit.
3. Open ASR.
4. Click the 3 dots icon at the top right.
5. Click Settings.
6. After the settings window opens, click the Cloud Services section.
7. Click the green + Add button at the bottom right.
8. Click OneDrive/Business.
9. Click the green Connect to the service button.
10. A Microsoft sign-in screen will appear... (yep, you know what happens now)
11. Click Sign-in options.
12. Click Sign in with Github.
13. Click the Github logo.
14. In the search box at the top right, type Google.
15. Click Search all of Github.
16. Click the Google link in the infobox about Google to the right of the screen.
17. You are in Google and all websites are unblocked!
18. As there are no tabs, use the forward and back keys on the top row of your keyboard.

Notes:
-> You can also use Box for Step 8 to get onto Google. Here's how:
8. Click Box.
9. Click the green Connect to the service button.
10. After the authenticating screen, a box sign-in screen will show up. Click Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.
11. On the cookie popup at the bottom that shows up (with the Accept all, Reject all and Customize buttons), click on "here" in the second/last sentence.
12. On the cookie notice page, scroll down a bit to see a table.
13. Find Google in this table (second column) and look at the third column next to it.
14. In this third column, click the first "here".
15. Scroll to the bottom on the Google Privacy page.
16. Click the small grey Google text.
17. You are in Google and all websites are unblocked!
18. As there are no tabs, use the forward and back keys on the top row of your keyboard.
