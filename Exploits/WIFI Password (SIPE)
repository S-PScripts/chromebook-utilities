SIPE - Sync Internals Password Extractor
Get your school's wifi password after using CAUB! (you can also use the non-CAUB one for any wifi)
Note: It might work without CAUB (it did for me) but I can't explain why that might be.

Steps:
1. Go to https://sipe.pages.dev/.
2. Start by putting the wifi name you would like to search for in the input box.
-> If you want to, you can put nothing to skip this step. However, if you don't you'll have to guess the name of the wifi you are trying to find in Step 8.
3. Click the magic button. It will tell you the wifi you need to click in Step 8.
4. Go to chrome://sync-internals/ in a new tab.
5. Click the Search tab.
6. Put in wifi_ in the text box.
7. Click the search button.
8. Click the name of the wifi you got from step 3. Note that it might be a longer string than what it says on SIPE.
9. Copy all of the data.
10. Go back to SIPE.
11. Put the data in the text box.
12. Click the magic button.
12. It will say that the data is successfully found. It will tell you the wifi name and password.
