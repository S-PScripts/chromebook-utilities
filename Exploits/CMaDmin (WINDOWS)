WINDOWS EXPLOIT

Requirements:
-> A brain
-> A Windows computer above Windows 7
-> A new administrator account (made through CMD prompt)

Instructions:
1. Access an admin Command Prompt/Powershell prompt. You can do this by booting into Windows PE, selecting "Advanced Options", then "Command Prompt". 
You can also use a Windows 10 Media Installation USB & select Next > Repair Your Computer > Troubleshoot > Command Prompt.
2. Create a new user by running these commands: "net {username} /add" & "net localgroup administrators {username} /add".
3. Login with the username & password you made. This account has administrator access.

If you want to access CMD prompt but it's blocked on the actual computer, hold shift + restart. It will take you to the recovery screen.
Once there, click advanced options and then click command prompt. And boom, you've got CMD Prompt.
