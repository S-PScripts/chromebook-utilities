FastBridge Learning Webview

WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS: 
-> UNRESTRICTED BROWSING
-> TEACHERS CAN'T SEE SCREEN
-> EXPLOIT STAYS WORKING EVEN AFTER CLOSING SCREEN.

NEGATIVES:
-> You're stuck in full screen
-> Only one tab at a time
-> You can only go to different websites using the Google home page or some other search engine if you can get to it.
--> USE THE 3kh0 REDIRECTOR to go to specific websites Google doesn't display. 
-> Logging into any Gmail account will make the exploit unusable and you'll have to power wash to be able to do it again
-> To go back and forth between pages, you have to use the arrow keys next to escape on your keyboard.
-> SOME PAGES LIKE GITHUB, YOUTUBE AND MANY OTHERS MAY BE blocked (since every proxy is now unblocked just use one of those...) 
--> The websites aren't being blocked by an extension, rather the organisation (when logged in you can probably go on the pages, but there seems to be some weird thing with it not allowing you to do so properly)

This was tested on ChromeOS v127. This exploit only works if you have the APP FastBridge Learning.

Instructions
1. First, Log out of your Chromebook,
2. Click the FastBridge Learning application in the bottom left in the 'apps category'.
3. Click the button in the top right, (it's to the right of 'check status')
-> Check status used to work as the exploit. However, it was patched and it took longer.
4. You'll see an about us tab in the list, hover over it and click the 'leadership' button.
5. Scroll down and you'll see a 'blackstone.com' button. Click that.
6. Once you're on this page, type in Google on the search bar and 'cookie policy' will show up in the list.
7. Click that and then scroll down to the contact area. You'll see this email - PrivacyQueries@gmail.com.
8. Click that link and you'll be sent to a Google page. Click the resources tab and click blog (no other Google pages work, somehow only blog works with this).
9. Scroll down all the way to the bottom. In the bottom left, a google logo will be shown. Click that and you'll be sent to the regular Google search page. Now, you can go on any website.

Notes:
-> IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE A PROXY THAT ALLOWS MULTI TABS SINCE YOU CANT HAVE MULTIPLE TABS IN THE BYPASS BY ITSELF.
-> If you read all this and don't have the app, you can try yourself to do this on any apps you may have.
