DAUB - Depthcharge Automatic Update Blocking
Block automatic updates in verified mode by deleting the update partitions.

It turns out you can just delete the update partitions, and depthcharge literally does not care, as long as it finds 1 valid kernel on the disk verified mode will work just fine, 
but without update partitions update_engine just completely fails. 

Also, depthcharge will never update the kernver until both update partitions have the updated kernver, meaning you can completely avoid kernver updates with this as well without breaking verity, 
so you're prepared for when new exploits release. We can also take advantage of the unused space to increase the stateful partition by about 2-4 GB.

How do you do this? It's incredibly easy:
-> Open Sh1mmer Or BadApple (or another root shell of some kind) and run the following (note /dev/mmcblk0 might be different depending on your board, e.g. /dev/mmcblk1 on grunt):

cgpt add /dev/mmcblk0 -i 2 -P 10 -T 5 -S 1
yes | mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p1
fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
# fdisk opens a menu here, run these commands in fdisk:
d
4

d
5

w

NOTE: This is VERY inconsistent! You could get bootlooped! 
The chances are pretty much 50/50 for no apparent reason whatsoever.

It's recommended you recover before doing this to prevent tpm_kernver from bricking you.
NOTE: This will not be patched since it's not an os-level problem, and it doesn't require Wi-fi like CAUB originally did.
The big difference is it requires a recovery to undo, so keep that in mind before doing this.
