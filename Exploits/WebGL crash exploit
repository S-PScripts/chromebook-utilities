I found out recently that if you can some how get WebGL to crash, you can access website without goguardian redirecting you.

1: make a bookmark of the website you want to visit.
2: get WebGL to crash, I don't know how to do this other than being teleported to a large amount of players withing you render
  distance while in fullscreen in EaglercraftX sometimes.
3: Rapidly click the bookmark, should be like four times, until goguardian stops redirecting you.
