Literally The Flagiest Exploit of All Time:

NOTES:
- This is not really an exploit, so it canâ€™t be patched.
- It uses a flag, which gives you a menu to decide which sites extensions are allowed on.

After enabling:
- Go to chrome://extensions and press on 'Site Permissions'

Please note that this is extremely policy-dependent, so it might work for different schools with the same extensions.

Versions: 
- Introduced inversion 125.0.6398.0, but as of Chrome version 133.0.6860.0, the new extensions menu is enabled by default in Chrome Canary builds.
