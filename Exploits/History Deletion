How to clear your history...

Notes:
For methods 1 and 2, you will lose all your files saved to your Chromebook. Make sure to back them up into your Google Drive.

Method 1:
1. Sign out of your account and remove the account from the device.
2. Sign back in and history should be gone.

Method 2:
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS WILL WIPE ALL SYNCED DATA, NOT JUST HISTORY. SYNCED DATA INCLUDES APPS, NON-MANAGED EXTENSIONS, BOOKMARKS, AND MORE.

1. Make sure you're synced to Google Chrome or else it won't work, as you need to be able to access chrome.google.com/sync.
2. Go to https://chrome.google.com/sync.
3. Press "clear data" at the bottom.
4. Sign out of your account and remove the account from the device.
5. Sign back in and history should be gone.

Method 3:
1. On a different device, login to your school account on Google Chrome.
2. Go to chrome://settings/clearBrowserData.
3. Clear whatever you want.
4. Profit.

Method 4:
If your school blocked chrome://history, it's because they want to prevent you from deleting your history by not being able to go to the history page.

1. Go to chrome://settings/clearBrowserData
2. You can now delete your history!

Method 5:
1. Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page) or powerwash.
2. Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off your wifi.
3. Go to chrome://settings/syncSetup/advanced.
4. Click Customize sync.
5. Turn off sync for History.
6. Save your changes and turn on your wifi.
