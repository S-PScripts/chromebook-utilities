Instructions:
1. Deprovision device in SH1MMER.
2. Do the downgrade with a lower version [v100] (a normal one, doesn't have to be special) - Dev mode NEEDS to be on, or it will complain it's too old
3. Grab a flash drive or SD card with Shimboot and plug it in
4. Boot using the Root X (X being A or B)
5. Profit?

Notes:
Basically, Shimboot is the bootloader for Chrome OS itself.
