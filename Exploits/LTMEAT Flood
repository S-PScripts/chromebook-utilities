This is LTMEAT Flood.

Extension page: chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/manifest.json
Extension settings: chrome://extensions/?id=<extensionidhere>
To get the ID, just go to chrome://extensions/ and find the blocking extension. Click on details and copy the part in the URL after ?id=

Instructions:
1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page lots of times. (About 800 minimum is recommended assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) 
It is recommended that you add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.
2. Right-click and open all in a new window.
3. Close the window with all those tabs.
4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang those tabs to take care of the old ones in the background that were just closed.
5. Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings and then you've bypassed the patch and the exploit is working.
6. Close everything and you're good to go. If it didn't work, try adjusting the number of tabs being opened. With this workaround, LTMEAT can endure a longer life!
