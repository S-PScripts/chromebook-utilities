LTMEAT got VEGAN!

Instructions:
1. Find the biggest file for your blocker extension - this is your blocker extension page. Here's an example for what it will look like:
chrome-extension://YourBlockerExtensionID/manifest.json
2. In a new tab, open chrome://extensions/?id=YourBlockerExtensionID - this is your Chrome extension tab.
3. On the blocker extension page, do CTRL + A to copy all the code.
4. Drag the copied text to the tabs bar. This may freeze your Chromebook a few times.
5. Start clicking the Chrome extension tab a few times. After this, wait. (your Chromebook is currently frozen).
6. When your Chromebook isn’t as frozen, right-click the blocker extension page tab and duplicate it.
7. Click the “Allow access to file URLs” in the extensions tab (multiple times for good measure).
8. The first tab should close itself. If both tabs closed themselves, you did something wrong. Just try again.
9. you should be able to normally use your Chromebook now.
-> You might be able to close the duplicated tab but not closing it might make the effect last longer.
