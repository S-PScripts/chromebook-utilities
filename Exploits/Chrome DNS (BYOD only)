How to enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in Chrome
DNS over HTTPS (DoH) - or "Secure DNS" as it is called in Chrome - is a way to encrypt DNS queries and responses between a user's device and the resolving DNS server.

To enable this in Chrome, do the following:
1. Go to chrome://settings/security.
2. Scroll down to the "Advanced" section.
3. Click "Use secure DNS" switch to enable.
4. Here you can specify your DNS provider / enter a DoH query URL:
http://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query
