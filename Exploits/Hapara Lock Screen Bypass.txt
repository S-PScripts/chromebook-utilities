Bypass the Hapara Lock Screen!

Instructions:
1. Make bookmarks of pages you want to visit beforehand.

2. Once your screen is paused, spam unfullscreen. Each time you do, you should see your tabs and bookmark bar come back. 
Attempt to right-click on the bookmarks bar until a menu shows up.

3. In the menu, select “Add folder”. Name it whatever you like. Hit Done. With luck, your tabs and bookmarks should stay at the top of your screen. If not, try again.

4. Once the tab and bookmarks bar stays, spam-click one of the bookmarks you made. This lags Hapara into displaying your page instead of the pause page. 
Turn off your wifi as soon as the page fully loads. This stops data flow between your and the teacher’s computer, so that they can’t re-pause your screen.
