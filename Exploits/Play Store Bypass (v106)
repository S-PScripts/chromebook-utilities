Unlock the Play Store for ChromeOS v106!

Make sure you are upgrading or powerwashing/recovering. Chrome Device Manager's notification should appear otherwise this will not work.
MAKE SURE TO HAVE A HOME ACCOUNT ADDED!

1. Log out/shutdown/restart when the Chrome Device Manager notif appears. LOCKING DOES NOT WORK.
2. Open the Play Store and keep it open. Try to download some apps. Fiddle around with it. Don't switch accounts as that might lock you out.
3. Add accounts in settings -> your school account name -> add account. You don't need to go to Android settings and shouldn't!

Method 2:
After powerwashing, recovering, and removing your account and adding it back in, do the following:
-> The moment Chrome Device Manager pops up, do chrome://restart.
-> After that, open Google Play and switch to your home account.
