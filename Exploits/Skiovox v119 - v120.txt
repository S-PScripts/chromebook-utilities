Skiovox (v119 - v120):

Notes:
A compatible kiosk application is required to perform this exploit.
Kiosk applications have their own profiles. This exploit uses a kiosk profile for Chrome browsing. Extensions can be installed from the Chrome Web Store or with Skebstore.
You can view the abandoned legacy writeup for information on this exploit.
Your Chromebook must be properly connected to a Wi-Fi network before you begin.

Instructions:
1. On the sign-in screen, disconnect from your network.
2. If usernames and photos are shown on the sign-in screen, enter your password, but do not press Enter. Otherwise, skip this step.
3. Launch one of your organization's kiosk applications. These can be found in the apps menu. Some might not work with this exploit.
4. Immediately press Alt + Shift + S. A toolbar should appear.
5. Wait for a Network Unavailable screen to appear.
6. In the toolbar, show the display settings menu by clicking the button next to the brightness slider.
7. Open display settings in the settings app by clicking the settings button in the toolbar menu.
8. Press Ctrl + Alt + Z to enable ChromeVox text-to-speech. A sound may play when this shortcut is used.
9. Select Resources. Three links should appear.
10. Click any of the three links shown. Chrome should open.
11. Press Ctrl + Alt + Z to disable ChromeVox text-to-speech.
12. Click sign in as an existing user.
13. Attempt to sign in. A Multiple sign-in has been disabled message should appear.
14. When the Multiple sign-in has been disabled message appears, press Esc to bypass it. A browsing window should be focused.
15. Close the focused browsing window.
16. Navigate to chrome://os-settings in the open settings window.
17. Connect to your network.
18. Close the settings window. A browsing window should be focused.
