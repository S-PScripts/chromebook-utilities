An IFrame runner with Turbowarp! Most schools don't ban Scratch due to it being mostly educational.
Since Turbowarp is basically the same as Scratch, it's probably not banned too.

Instructions:
1. Go to Turbowarp's editor with this link: https://turbowarp.org/editor?extension=https://extensions.turbowarp.org/iframe.js
-> The website above will automatically include the Turbowarp extension IFrame so you don't need to add it yourself from the menu.
2. Go to the "Iframe" tab and use one of the following:
   -> Website - Add in your web url that you want to view.
   -> HTML - Put in HTML code to view.
3. Click on the green part of the block.

Notes:
Once you want to close the IFrame, click on "Close IFrame".

If your school blocks specific youtube videos, then you can view this guide to help you bypass the restrictions:

Alternatively, you can use one of the links in this file to use as an alternative to youtbe:

If the main Turbowarp link is blocked, try using this Turbowarp link instead:
https://mirror.turbowarp.xyz/editor?extension=https://extensions.turbowarp.org/iframe.js

If both Turbowarp links are banned, you can use PenguinMod:
https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html - you will have to add the extension yourself.

If PenguinMod is banned, make your own Turbowarp mirror by following the instructions here:
