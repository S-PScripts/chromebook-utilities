This bypass will get you a Google tab without any extensions like Securly, Blocksi and more.
Keep in mind that websites blocked by the chromebook admin itself will not work, so for example if you visited a certain site and it said, "The person who set up this computer has chosen to block this site," 
or if your admin has an extension whitelist instead of a blocklist, this will not work.
However, you have to already have the extension downloaded. It has been removed from the Web Store.

Instructions:
1. Head over to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coding-with-chrome/becloognjehhioodmnimnehjcibkloed or search up "Coding with Chrome" in the Web Store and open it.
2. Add the app to Chrome. After it is added, launch it.
3. Select "Programming" if you are asked to.
4. Open "Markup" and click on the Form template.
5. Delete everything in the template's HTML and paste this code:

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <a href="https://google.com/">Google”>
</a>
</head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

(you can email it to yourself if you're viewing this on a personal device)

6. Click the "Google" Link in the preview window.
7. You now have access to a Google Tab without any blocker extensions.

This should work because the extension is made by Google Chrome itself and therefore has a low chance of being blocked.
