KVS (Kernel Version Switcher) - Change to any kernel version (unpatch downgrading)

What is this?
KVS is a project which will change your tpm_kernver to any version. This works by writing custom values to 0x1008 TPM index.

How do I use this?
1) Please make sure you are unenrolled / FWMP does not exist.
2) Download a shim from kxtz' shim mirror [https://dl.darkn.bio/KVS]
3) Flash your shim using a tool of your choice. Chrome Recovery Utility is preferred.
