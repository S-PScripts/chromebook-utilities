Quicksilver - unenrollment from chromeOS v125 - v142 (KV4 - KV6)

Instructions: 

If your device can boot SH1MMER (unkeyrolled):
- Boot SH1MMER (make sure the version is from at least December 15th 2025)
- Open the payloads menu and run the quicksilver payload
- Go through setup; you should be unenrolled!
- If your version is from before December 15th 2025, run this command in the bash shell: vpd -i RW_VPD -s re_enrollment_key="$(openssl rand -hex 32)". It will say unable to write 'random state'; ignore this.

If your device cannot boot SH1MMER (keyrolled):
- Do ⁠Sh1ttyExec <143
- Enable Developer mode & then enter Recovery mode again.
- Boot a GoodSilver image and choose "Deprovision".
- After it reboots, go through setup; you will be unenrolled!

This is persistent if you're on an unpatched version (<=v142)! If you're not updated & want to re-enroll, run vpd -i RW_VPD -d "re_enrollment_key" in any shell.
Please look at ⁠Avoiding accidental re-enrollment if you update to a patched version.
