How to unblock any site in a few seconds...

1. Make a Google document (docs.new).
2. Add some links. (for example, Discord or Tiktok)
3. Download that doc as a PDF.
4. Open the PDF.
5. Click a link.
6. It's likely the website won't be blocked by your extension! 

Notes:
-> Reloading or going to a link on that website that redirects to something else will block it again.
-> Securly works with this exploit!
