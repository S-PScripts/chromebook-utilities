The secondary rate limit:
If you go on GitHub enough, you will receive a secondary rate limit. Luckily, there is a way to mitigate this.

1. Click on the little thing that says @githubstatus, or any other elon musk site thing that may happen to appear.
2. On Twitter, click sign in with apple.
3. Click on the Apple logo.
4. Search up Youtube in the apple search bar.
5. Scroll down and click "visit developer site".
6. You can stop here if you're a nerd, or you can click on the youtube settings/widget bar and click on the terms of service.
7. Click on the google license link at the bottom.
8. Yippie yay! You did it!

Note: There is probably a way to simplify the latter part.
