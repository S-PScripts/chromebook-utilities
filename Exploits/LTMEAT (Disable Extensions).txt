This is LTMEAT, an exploit to unblock ANY website! Note that this has been patched for some time.
Patched since chromeOS v115.

Extension page (bookmark this): chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/manifest.json
Bookmark this: chrome://kill
Bookmark this: chrome://hang
To get the ID, just go to chrome://extensions/ and find the blocking extension. Click on details and copy the part in the URL after ?id=

Instructions:
2. Click the first bookmark (the extension page).
3. Click the second bookmark to kill that page.
4. Immediately start spam clicking the third bookmarklet to hang the page.
5. Reload within one to two seconds of killing the extension page whilst spamming.
6. If you can't visit the extension page afterwards, you've done it right!

Notes:
If there seems to be an infinity load on any page that the extension page would block, restart your chromebook and try again.
