Here's how to see your ChromeOS version:

Method 1:
- Go to chrome://version.
- It should have a number like v1xx on version for one of the lines - this is your chromeOS version. Ignore anything after the decimal, it probably doesn't matter for you.

Method 2:
- Go to Settings, scroll down to the "About chromeOS" or update page, and it should say the version.

Method 3:
- Go to the lockscreen (ctrl+shift+q+q, sign out, restart the chromebook) and press ALT+V.
- It should show the version in the top right, “Google Chrome X”.

Method 4:
1. Go to chrome://system/
2. Wait until it finishes loading.
3. Check one of these sections:
CHROME VERSION
os-release VERSION
os-release VERSION_ID

If chrome://system is blocked, do CTRL + SEARCH + I, enter anything in the description, click Continue, then click the blue System and app info text.

Method 5:
1. Go to chrome://nacl/
2. The first line should be Google Chrome (your version).
