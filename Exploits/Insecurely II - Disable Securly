Insecurely II - Disable Securly (and possibly other blocking extensions)

Requirements
-> Access to chrome://indexeddb-internals
-> A blocking extension that uses indexeddb (e.g. Securly)

Instructions:
1. Go to chrome://indexeddb-internals
2. Scroll down till you see chrome-extension://(securly extension id). It should be joflmkccibkooplaeoinecjbmdebglab, iheobagjkfklnlikgihanlhcddjoihkg or ckecmkbnoanpgplccmnoikfmpcdladkc.
3. Click Force Stop
4. That's all... no more blocked websites!

Notes:
-> Securly sometimes does kick back in (although it takes a while) but all you need to do is force stop it again.

EXTENSIONS CURRENTLY WORKING:
Securly

EXTENSIONS NOT WORKING:
-> Goguardian
-> Lightspeed 
-> Linewize
-> Blocksi
-> iboss

FAQ: 
"The Securly extension ID you gave isn't there":
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click on Securly.
3. Check what the id is (URL bar).

If it's still not there, this exploit is probably patched.
