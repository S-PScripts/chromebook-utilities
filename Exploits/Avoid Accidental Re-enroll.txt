Avoiding accidental re-enrollment

# r110 and lower:

- Run this command in any root shell:
vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=0

- Then powerwash (verified or developer mode)

# r111-r124:
CL: https://crrev.com/c/4255465

- Run these commands in a developer mode root shell (or a shim with CTRL+U boot):
vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=0
tpm_manager_client take_ownership
cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters

- Then powerwash (verified or developer mode)

# r125-r135:
CL: https://crrev.com/c/5454834

- Powerwash, go to developer mode, enter VT2, and run these commands (make sure to type the `>` and `>>` exactly as you see them):
echo --enterprise-enable-unified-state-determination=never >/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
echo --enterprise-enable-forced-re-enrollment=never >>/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
echo --enterprise-enable-initial-enrollment=never >>/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
mount --bind /tmp/chrome_dev.conf /etc/chrome_dev.conf
initctl restart ui

- Then switch out of VT2 and set up the device (don't reboot until you've finished setting it up).

# r136+
CL: https://crrev.com/c/6309012

echo --enterprise-enable-state-determination=never >/tmp/chrome_dev.conf
mount --bind /tmp/chrome_dev.conf /etc/chrome_dev.conf
initctl restart ui

- Then switch out of VT2 and set up the device (don't reboot until you've finished setting it up).
