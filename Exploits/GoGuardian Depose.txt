GoGuardian Depose

Why is this exploit called GoGuardian Depose?
This is because it used the name of the software and the verb "depose" since it means "to remove from a throne or other high position". 
This is representative of what GoGuardian Depose does since it strips the spyware of its control and ability to censor your access to sites.

What is the Basic Enforcement Policy?
This is a nickname for the fact that GoGuardian keeps a HARD block list which are blocks that can't be removed when the policy is re-downloaded. 
For example, GoGuardian still blocks going to IP addresses even after you re-download the policy. Since most Chromebook policies change your wifi to an organisation-approved one if in range 
after signing in, just connecting to it before won't work.

How to easily bypass GoGuardian with a DNS blocking + set up a hotspot that uses a VPN to bypass web blocks.
