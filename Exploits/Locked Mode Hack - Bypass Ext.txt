LoMoH
Formerly named "Locked Mode Hack," this Chrome OS exploit uses the locked mode feature to soft disable force-enabled extensions on managed accounts (Excluding Hapara Highlights and Read&Write if installed).

Javascript edition: Will only work on older versions of ChromeOS since Javascript was blocked in bookmarklets

You must create your link with the button on the page for locked mode to work within your organization/district.
If this is patched for you, you will get rickrolled attempting to perform this exploit. This is just a heads-up for those who do happen to read this.
