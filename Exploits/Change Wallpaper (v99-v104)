Change your wallpaper that's set by policy (v99-v104).

Instructions:
1. Head to chrome://flags.
2. Search for "Personalization".
3. Enable "Personalization Hub UI".
4. Restart.
5. Right click your desktop, click "Personalize" (or find "Personalize your device" in settings).
6. Go to "Wallpaper" -> anything that's not "My Images" (for example: Cityscapes, Heritage, etc).
7. Click "Change Daily".
8. It’ll throw an error but it changes the wallpaper anyway.
9. Head back to the main Wallpaper menu again.
10. Go to "My Images".
11. Select whatever image you want.
12. You’re done! Have fun!

Notes:
You have to repeat steps 5-11 every time you restart.
I'm on v104, and it doesn't work.
