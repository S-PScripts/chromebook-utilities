Issues with SKIOVOX:
-> Adding Google accounts and installing extensions are difficult.
-> Moving and resizing windows is difficult.
-> Most keyboard shortcuts are not functional.

SKIOVOX Helper can restore this functionality. This does not need to be set up every time SKIOVOX is performed.

Features:
-> Fixes most shortcut functionality within the exploit
-> Allows for resizing and dragging of windows
-> Makes it easier to add Google accounts and use the Web Store within the exploit
-> Fixes functionality of some Google logins on webpages
-> Allows you to see time, date, and battery.
Note: You can exit fullscreen by pressing ctrl+T after you've set up the shortcuts.

Instructions:
1. Download SKIOVOX Helper from https://github.com/bypassiwastaken/skiovox-helper/releases.
