This is a chrome://sign-in webview (exploit) for people that get "This account is not allowed to sign in within this network." if they try to put in a personal email.

Notes before starting:
-> This only works in the UK.
-> You will need to be able to connect to EE Wifi.

Instructions
Go to chrome://chrome-signin/
Connect to EE Wifi.
Keep reloading the page until the sign in page DOESN'T immediately show a "Connect to EE Wifi". It should load for a while instead of saying "Connect to EE Wifi".
After a while, the page will finish loading, showing "Your connection is not private". Type in "thisisunsafe".
