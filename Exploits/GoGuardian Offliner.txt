Prevent teachers from seeing your screen when they're on GoGuardian!

Instructions:
1. Create a new bookmark folder and paste the new tab page 150 times.
2. Create a new desk.
3. Open Chrome and right-click the folder you've just created.
4. Click Open all.
5. Exit out of that window without closing the tabs.
6. Go back to the original desk you were using for school work... or to now play games.
7. Profit! The teacher will see you as being offline.
