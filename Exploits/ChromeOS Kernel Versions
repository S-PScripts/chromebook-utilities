ChromeOS Kernel Versions

What is a kernver and what does it mean for me?
Kernel verisons, often referred to as kernvers, are what chromebooks use to lock down how low of a version you can update to.

If you are on these kernvers, these are the minimum chromeos versions you can use.
Kernver	Minimum Chromeos Verison
0	any
1	any
2	v111
3	v120
4	v125

Determining your kernver
1. Hold esc+power+refresh for a bit less than a second.
2. Once the recovery screen appears, press tab.
3. It should show a line that starts with “TPM:” and ends with “0”, “1”, “2”, “3”, or “4”. If it's a higher number, this file is probably not up to date. The number it ends with is your kernver.
