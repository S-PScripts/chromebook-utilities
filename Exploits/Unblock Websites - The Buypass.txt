How it works:
There's an obscure API in most browsers called the Payment Request API. 
The use purpose is to provide an easy way for websites to make transactions. 
In practice, this means opening a small window containing a website. 
In short, this weird window messes up the filtering of some extensions.

What it can and can't do:
-> This only lasts for 3 minutes!
-> Pages visited in this window will not be saved to your history, but their cookies will be saved.
-> You can right-click on the window to go back and forward.
-> There's no good way to make the text in the window larger.
-> This won't bypass network filters.
-> You can't log into non-school accounts.
-> It's completely possible that some filters could read and block the data sent within the window. Mine does...
-> Don't try to make more than one tab to get multiple windows. Only one will work at a time.
