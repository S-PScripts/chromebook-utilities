SPEM (Securly Percent Encoding Method)
New Securly bypass for all versions as of Oct 6, 2025

NOTE:
THIS METHOD can work on other extensions! This has not been tested, but has been confirmed to work on Securly for multiple different schools, areas, and Chromebooks.

How it works:
Overloading Securly + Dyknow Cloud causing both extensions to not respond for the current page.

Requirements:
- Securly + Dyknow Cloud
- Preferred Securly extension ID: ckecmkbnoanpgplccmnoikfmpcdladkc

Steps to do it: 
- Go to any of these websites that are unblocked for you

- When you are on the website, you can choose the power + multiplier
-- Recommended: A power of 200 and multiplier of 100-200
--- If your device is slow, decrease the multiplier.

- Click the copy button
- It should copy the link to your clipboard; the link consists of a ton of h's (percent encoded), which overloads extensions
- Now just go to the site!
- If you are trying to go to different pages inside of the site, hover over the URL and drag it to your search bar, then put that into the website and generate another URL.
