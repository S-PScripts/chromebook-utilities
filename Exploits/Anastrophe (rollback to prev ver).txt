DEVELOPER MODE MUST BE RESTRICTED FOR THIS TO WORK

Anastrophe (derived from Greek) is an exploit abusing an intended feature within Chrome OS’s OOBE sequence.
Essentially, the exploit allows you to downgrade to whichever version you were previously on. It has been proven to work on the latest Chrome version, v136. 
This exploit was found by @gabeisthatyou.

Instructions:
- Enter Recovery Mode
- Commence the developer mode sequence (it is expected to fail)
- As soon as the fail screen appears, press Escape + Enter
- Once rebooted, enter demo mode (via CTRL + Alt + D) & connect to wifi
- Press CTRL + Alt + Shift + R twice, then press revert

For best results, wait until demo mode asks you to agree with policies to do step five.

Returning to your school-enforced version (requires newer recovery UI):
- Enter Recovery Mode
- Press Internet Recovery and allow itself to complete
- Powerwash via developer mode’s fail safe sequence.

Assuming you downgraded to kernel 4 (any version before v133), Anastrophe is paired best with the guest mode exploit. Feel free to experiment with this exploit and find others to pair this with.
