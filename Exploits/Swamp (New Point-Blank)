Run bookmarklets on privileged pages with Swamp (New Point-Blank).
Bookmarklets must not be blocked by policy to perform this exploit.

Swamp functions like LTBEEF, the GUI-based exploit which Bypassi originally created for disabling extensions. 
However, unlike LTBEEF, Swamp still remains unpatched on versions post-v102 up to even v107.

This will allow you to:
-> Disable force-installed extensions similarly to LTBEEF even on Chrome 107 where it's patched
-> Run bookmarklets on any page even when they are blocked
-> Break extensions until a powerwash (or until you choose to turn it back on)
-> Run a custom DNS to block network requests without actually being on a DNS
-> Run your own custom code with access to most of the Chrome API

Securly:

If your school updated GoGuardian, this exploit may not work.

Instructions:
1. Bookmark the code in this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kh0/ext-remover/main/newpointblank.js
2. Go to the link your extension matches to above.
3. Most of these links are a block page. This is intentional.
4. Each page should have a blue link. Click the link on the page.
5. If it opens a blank page, click the bookmarklet that you just made.
6. Click either hard disable or soft disable. Soft disable will only disable extensions until you restart your Chromebook.

Notes:
-> You can also run scripts and code.
-> However, your extension may disable javascript running on it so running your own code may not work.
-> It is recommended to do soft disable, which only disables it until restart.
