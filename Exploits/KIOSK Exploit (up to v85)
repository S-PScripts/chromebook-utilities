KIOSK Exploit

Although many variations of this exploit exist, this was the very original implementation of it. 
However, the process never went as far or flexible as a full Chrome browser window being able to be created out of this method rather than just a simple bypass within the KIOSK app.

This exploit allows you to open an unrestricted Chrome instance within a kiosk app, i.e. with the kiosk user account permissions.

Requirements:
-> Any kiosk app installed
-> [method 1] [for v77 to v85] OOBE/fresh install.

Method 1:
1. Sign out.
2. Turn your wifi off.
3. Enable ChromeVox (CTRL+ALT+Z).
4. Open a kiosk app.
5. Spam Search+O+K (you do have to re-click O and K).
6. While spamming, click "Diagnose".
7. Profit!

Method 2:
1. Recover/powerwash and don't sign in.
2. Turn your wifi off.
3. Open a kiosk app and wait for the error screen
4. Press CTRL+ALT+Z to enable ChromeVox.
5. Start spamming Search+O (you can hold search down but spam o)
6. While spamming, press "Diagnose", keep spamming until a browser window pops up (it may take up to 5 seconds)
7. Open a new tab, then press ctrl+alt+z to disable ChromeVox.
8. If you need internet, visit chrome://os-settings to turn wifi back on.

Notes: 
-> The exploit should work consistently v76 or below but it's still possible to pull off on v85 or below, but only once (right after you powerwash).
