This is LTBEEF with service workers - JPCMG!

Requirements:
-> Access to chrome://serviceworker-internals
-> Inspect element enabled
   If you don't have inspect element, do DPS at https://github.com/S-PScripts/chromebook-utilities/blob/main/Exploits/Disable%20Extensions%20-%20DPS

Instructions:
1. Go to chrome://serviceworker-internals.
2. Find your extension. Some extensions will not work with this exploit and some may not show in the list.
3. Hit the start button then the Inspect button.
4. Execute this line of code: chrome.management.setEnabled('<extension id here>',false)
5. All pages should be unblocked now!

To undo: run chrome.management.setEnabled('<extension id here>',true)

Alternative method:
1. Go to chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/manifest.json.
2. Open Inspect and go to Console.
3. Execute this line of code: chrome.management.setEnabled('<extension id here>',false)
4. All pages should be unblocked now!
