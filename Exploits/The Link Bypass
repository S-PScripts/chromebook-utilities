Securly is good at blocking but there is a simple bypass!

Instructions:
1. Add #translate.google.com to the end of any link.
2. It'll load (probably), even if it's supposed to be banned. Profit!

This also might work for other blocking extensions too (not mine though).
If it works for you, you should make the most of it until it gets patched...
