This is CAUB On Cocaine - a version of CAUB that uses chrome://flags.

Instructions:
1. Go to chrome://flags#show-metered-toggle.
2. Enable it and click Restart. For me, it was already set to default (on).
3. Go to Settings.
4. Click Wi-Fi.
5. Click the wifi you want to stop updates from happening.
If it's not there then click Known networks - it'll be there.
6. Click Advanced.
7. Enable Metered Network.
