Introduction on Skiovox:
Skiovox is an exploit that allows for browsing within a completely unblocked Chrome browser. 
It works on ChromeOS v118 and a wide range of previous versions. 

-> Skiovox utilises a bug in kiosk apps
-> It's very similar to a bug from 3 years ago 
-> Within the unblocked browser, you can install extensions
-> It bypasses pretty much all blocks

How to use it:
Go through one of these links that has a slideshow Bypassi made with the instructions!
