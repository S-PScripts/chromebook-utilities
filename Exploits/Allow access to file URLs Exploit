Steps:
Step 1: Go to chrome://extensions/. If this is blocked, you can't do this.
Step 2: Find the extension you want to restart.
Step 3: Click the Details button.
Step 4: Look for the Allow access to file URLs toggle. If this toggle is absent, you can't do this exploit.
Step 5: Toggle it. The extension should turn off and on quickly.

With this exploit, you will have a small window of time to open a blocked website.
