GoodSilver https://unenrollment.com/
GoodSilver is a port of QuickSilver to BadRecovery so devices that cannot boot shims can unenroll with QuickSilver.

Requirements:
- A USB drive or SD card (8 GB or larger)
- Something to flash the image (dd, rufus, chromebook recovery utility, etc.)
- A ChromeOS device that is below r143

Downloads: https://unenrollment.com/GoodSilver

Building an image
- First, you must download an official r124 recovery image for your device. You can download them from ChromiumDash or cros.download.
- Be sure you’ve downloaded the correct image for your device.

- Make sure to unzip the recovery image before proceeding to the next step!

- Next, you must modify the recovery image using the script included with this repository.

- To get the script, run these commands on a linux machine:
git clone https://github.com/AerialiteLabs/GoodSilver && cd GoodSilver

- To modify a recovery image using the script, run
sudo ./build_goodsilver.sh -i <image.bin>
(Replace <image.bin> with the path to your recovery image bin.)

- The script may prompt you to install required dependencies.

- The recovery image is now modified, and is ready to be flashed to a USB drive or SD card.

Running on ChromeOS device (this is an example utilizing Sh1ttyExec by lxrd):
- Powerwash the device by pressing [Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R]
- Start enrolling the device then open the powerwash menu [Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R] and wait till it crashes back to OOBE (‘Get Started’ screen)
- Try enrolling again but the moment your chromebook says ‘Enterprise Enrollment’, enter recovery mode [Esc+Ref+Pwr].
- Enter Developer mode [Ctrl+D].
- Enter recovery mode again by pressing [Esc+Ref+Pwr]
- Plug in the prepared USB drive or SD card. GoodSilver will start in only a few seconds if you’ve done everything correctly. If not, turn off developer mode and try again from the start
- Go through setup; you should be unenrolled!
