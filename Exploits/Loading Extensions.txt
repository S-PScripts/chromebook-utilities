Here's an odd way to install any extension. It's quite useless, but it might help if the Web Store is disabled for you (I haven't tried).

Requirements:
-> chrome://extensions Developer Mode availability

Instructions:
-> Get the Web Store link for your extension. It should look like this:
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/.../...?hl=en
[Note: If you cannot go to the Web Store for whatever reason, go here. You may have to modify it a bit:
https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx?response=redirect&acceptformat=crx2,crx3&prodversion=135.0.7049.104&x=id%3D <EXTENSION ID HERE> %26installsource%3Dondemand%26uc
-> Go to https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/
-> Paste the URL into the box and click "Open in this viewer". If you used the client2 link above, upload it to the website instead.
-> Wait for it to load.
-> Click "Download". It will download the extension as a ZIP.
-> Create a new folder (the name can be anything).
-> Unzip the ZIP. Put everything in the ZIP into the folder you created in the previous step.
-> Go to chrome://extensions.
-> Switch Developer Mode on.
-> Click "Load unpacked".
-> Find the folder you made and click on it. Finally, click "Open".
-> The extension should install! :D
