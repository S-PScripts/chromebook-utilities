You need to be able to use the Linux development environment to do this.

1. Open the Settings app, go to System and enable Linux development environment.
2. Go to Apps -> Manage Google Play preferences -> Android Settings.
3. Go to About, and click Build Number 7 times.
4. Go back to ChromeOS Settings and once Linux is finished installing, open the submenu and enable “Develop android apps”
5. On reboot, click Confirm and log back in.
6. Open Android Settings and Terminal. On Android Settings, go to System -> Developer options -> Enable ADB debugging and Wireless debugging. [Note down the IP address and port listed here.]
7. In Linux, run `sudo apt install adb` after performing a repository sync (`sudo apt update`). [Run the command `adb connect <ip:port>` and allow USB debugging when you get the prompt. Rerun the command.]
8. List all devices with `adb devices` and take note of the one that starts with “emulator”. Copy any APK files you want to install to Linux with the Files app, and run `adb -s emulator-XXXX install <filename.apk>`.
9. Installed apps will be available in the start menu.
