Multi-user signin on ChromeOS (KV1-4) (Unenrolled)

Instructions:
1. Downgrade to r130 or any version below r130, r105 is good but it's showing its age now.
2. Do ⁠DAUB.
3. Set GBB flags to 0x80b1 (you can ask people in TN how to do this if you dont know).
4. Go to Developer mode.
5. Enter VT2 (CTRL + ALT + ->) then login as root and run this:
mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed
curl -SLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainestorme/murkmod/refs/heads/main/pollen.json -o /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/policy.json

6. Go back to chrome (CTRL + ALT + <-) and go to chrome://policy and press refresh policies
7. Now, log out of your gmail account and add your school account.
8. Once you added your school account, log out and go back to your main gmail account.
9. Press the time / wifi / battery area and then press the arrow next to the power button IN THE MENU.
10. Press your email then "sign in another user".
11. Sign in to your school account.
12. Finally, you can switch between the two with CTRL+ALT+.

Murkmod's pollen.json has more stuff than fakemurk, although, it is not recommended.
If you have fakemurk or murkmod installed already, you can skip to step 7 (unless you're on r131 and above).

PS: If your school sets ChromeOsMultiProfileUserBehavior to unrestricted in policies, you can skip to step 7.
