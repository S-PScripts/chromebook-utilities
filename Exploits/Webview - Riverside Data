Explanation: 
-> When you spam enter after tabbing to the link, it causes it to launch a window but it closes before you see it.
-> However, if you do it rapidly, it lets one or more through,.
-> If you click on it while it is shown, then it can't terminate it.
-> The chrome instance that opens is like incognito mode.
-> Your school or workplace can't see what you search up other than if they look at the router history.
-> It had no extensions enabled and the only way a website can be blocked on there is if it's a WiFi DNS block or Router DNS block.
