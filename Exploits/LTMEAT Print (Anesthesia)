LTMEAT but it's done by using the print method!

Extension page: chrome-extension://<extensionidhere>/manifest.json
Extension settings: chrome://extensions/?id=<extensionidhere>
To get the ID, just go to chrome://extensions/ and find the blocking extension. 
Click on details and copy the part in the URL after ?id=

Instructions:
1. Go to the extension page and hit Ctrl+P. A print window should show up with a number of pages in the top right.
2. Do everything you can to increase that number. Shrink down margins, change layout to landscape, anything you can.
The higher you can get that number, the longer the effect will last. 
3. Hit reload. The page should start hanging.
4. Go to your extension's settings page.
5. Duplicate your printing tab and go back to your extension's settings page.
6. Flip the "Allow Access to file URLS" switch.
7. Presto! Go have fun on the (probably) unblocked web.
