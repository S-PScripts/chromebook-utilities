How to clear your history...

Notes:
For methods 1 and 2, you will lose all your files saved to your Chromebook. Make sure to back them up into your Google Drive.
It's likely your SYS admin can still see your history even if you remove it from your device.

Method 1:
1. Sign out of your account and remove the account from the device.
2. Sign back in and history should be gone.

Method 2:
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS WILL WIPE ALL SYNCED DATA, NOT JUST HISTORY. SYNCED DATA INCLUDES APPS, NON-MANAGED EXTENSIONS, BOOKMARKS, AND MORE.

1. Make sure you're synced to Google Chrome or else it won't work, as you need to be able to access chrome.google.com/sync.
2. Go to https://chrome.google.com/sync.
3. Press "clear data" at the bottom.
4. Sign out of your account and remove the account from the device.
5. Sign back in and history should be gone.

Method 3:
1. On a different device, login to your school account on Google Chrome.
2. Go to chrome://settings/clearBrowserData.
3. Clear whatever you want.
4. Profit.

Method 4:
If your school blocked chrome://history, it's because they want to prevent you from deleting your history by not being able to go to the history page.

1. Go to chrome://settings/clearBrowserData
2. You can now delete your history!

Method 5:
1. Esc+Refresh+Power and re-enroll (Enter recovery page) or powerwash.
2. Log into your Chromebook and immediately turn off your wifi.
3. Go to chrome://settings/syncSetup/advanced.
4. Click Customize sync.
5. Turn off sync for History.
6. Save your changes and turn on your wifi.
