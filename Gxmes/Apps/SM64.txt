Story...
https://super-mario-64--landonperkins1.repl.co/ stopped working after Replit closed free deployments.
Now all repl.co links go to their code pages. The one above is https://replit.com/@LandonPerkins1/Super-Mario-64#anti-steal.js.
And oh look, Replit busted Landon Perkins! He stole it from jscraft!
I went onto jscraft's and they updated their repl to the new site (Glitch).
So it's still here!
