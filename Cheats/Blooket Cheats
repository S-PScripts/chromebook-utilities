Original:
https://github.com/Minesraft2/Blooket-gui

Unfortunately, minesraft2 got a cease and desistfromby Blooket (and got terminated from Github). 
05konz would back it up with permission from minesraft2 and then proceed to start making updates for the project.
Since 05konz's Github was deleted, they now update Blooket Cheats on Gitlab.

This was used as a backup (NOT UPDATED!):
